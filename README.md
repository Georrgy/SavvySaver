**Idea**

The application was conceived to address a common question among prospective
investors: "When is the right time to invest?" By simulating past investment
scenarios with actual historical data, Savvy Savor provides a visual and
analytical journey through the financial implications of such decisions.

**Features**

- **Investment Time Travel**: Select a company, pick a historical date, and
  visualize the potential growth of your investment over time.
- **Optimal Trade Window Analysis**: Identify the perfect moments for market
  entry and exit, and calculate net profits from hypothetical trades.
- **Historical Trend Performance**: Assess the benefits of long-term investment
  strategies by observing the growth from the lowest market points to the
  present day.
- **Market Peak Investment Outcome**: Understand the risks involved in entering
  the market at peak prices.
- **Learning Hub**: Access a curated selection of financial resources, including
  podcasts and expert insights to enhance your investment knowledge.

**How It Works**

Choose a company and a date in the past, and Savvy Savor will illustrate the
investment's performance through interactive charts and detailed analyses. For
example, investing €50,000 in IBM in 2005 could have potentially doubled to
€98,500 today.
